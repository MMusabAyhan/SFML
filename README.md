# SFML
Some retro games made by SFML

This repository is created to learn more basics of game development.
The goal is increase the awareness of how big engines like unreal
actually ease the making of a game with its tool set.

Here, I will create games using SFML library. I plan to have a better
understanding on how a game loop is utilized to develop a game and how things
are rendered onto screen. And also, I want to see how the other systems are
made such as collision, animation and UI from kind of scratch. 

At the end, I aim to increase my overall core knowledge on these basics of
game development.
